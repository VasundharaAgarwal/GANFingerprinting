This is the code repository accompanying the Part II Project titled ***Investingating Robustness of GAN Fingerprint Detection Algorithms***. The code has been split by functionality into 7 notebooks with self-explanatory titles. The executable code cells in the notebooks are interspersed with inline visualisations of the results, keeping true to he investigatory nature of the project and allowing a readable, tutorial-like presentation of the work that I have done. Code snippets reused across notebooks have been defined as functions in 2 importable modules.
